We want you to create the server side of a blogging application consisting of an HTTP API and a database. There is no need to build a front-end for the application. The API should be able to:

Create, update, delete users.
Allow users to manage their posts.
At the end we expect the code and instructions on how to run it. You are free to create it with whatever tools you like, but we are heavy users of python + flask mostly using Go, so these are this is preferred. The focus of the challenge is to see how you write code, not the details of specific features how users and posts are managed, so feel free to make assumptions about how the product works. Please make sure to document your assumptions and include them with the codebase
